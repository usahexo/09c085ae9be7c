The Christmas season begins on Christmas Eve and ends on Epiphany, January 6. Customs and traditions vary from country to country, but some are common to most Catholic countries.</p>
<p>In many countries, a crib or Nativity scene is set up in a prominent place in the home. The figures may be made of wood, plastic, or other materials, and may be bought or hand-crafted. Many families attend Mass on Christmas Eve and midnight Mass is often broadcast on television. In some countries like Spain, Italy, and Germany a special bread called “pan de pascua” is eaten. It is a sweet bread with dried fruit and nuts.</p>
<p>Children often leave out cookies and milk for Santa Claus (or Father Christmas) on Christmas Eve. They also hang up stockings or put presents under the tree for him to find on Christmas morning. Some families have special foods that they eat only at Christmastime, such as goose in Germany or Capirotada (a type of bread pudding) in Mexico.</p>
<p>The Christmas season ends with Epiphany on January 6th. Epiphany celebrates the visit of the Magi (wise men) to Bethlehem to see the baby Jesus. In some countries like Spain and Italy, people throw water over each other on Epiphany to celebrate Jesus’ baptism.</p>

But there are a number of customs and traditions associated with Christmas that differ from how it is typically celebrated by the general population.</p>
<p>One such custom is the sending of Christmas cards. Many people send cards to family and friends during the holiday season, often including pictures of Christmas trees or other winter scenes. Another custom is the hanging of stockings by the fireplace, which is said to bring good luck to the person who hangs them up.</p>
<p>Another tradition associated with Christmas is the giving of gifts. Often, people will purchase gifts for their loved ones, either in advance or shortly before Christmas Day. There are also a number of traditional gift items that are given as part of Christmas, such as Christmas sweaters, pajamas, and stocking stuffers.</p>
<p>Many families also observe religious traditions associated with Christmas. For example, many people attend midnight mass on Christmas Eve or say special prayers before eating their Christmas dinner. Some families even exchange presents on Christmas Day itself rather than on December 25th.</p>
<p>Each family celebrates Christmas in its own way, but there are a number of common customs and traditions that are observed by many people during the holiday season.</p>
<h1 id="What-specific-liturgical-rites-are-performed-during-the-Christmas-Mass"><a href="#What-specific-liturgical-rites-are-performed-during-the-Christmas-Mass" class="headerlink" title="What specific liturgical rites are performed during the Christmas Mass?"></a>What specific liturgical rites are performed during the Christmas Mass?</h1><p>Christmas Mass is a Catholic liturgical celebration of the birth of Jesus. It is usually celebrated on December 25th, the day after Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Several specific rites are performed during the Christmas Mass. These include the procession of the gifts, readings from the Bible, singing of carols, and the sermon. The Mass also includes a propers section, which contains special prayers and texts specific to the Christmas season.</p>
<p>The procession of the gifts is a ritual in which the congregation brings gifts to be given to God and to Christ’s poor. The gifts are typically brought up to the altar at the beginning of Mass.</p>
<p>There are several readings from the Bible that are included in the Christmas Mass. These readings recount key moments from Jesus’ birth, life, death, and resurrection. They are chosen specifically to reflect on the meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>The singing of carols is an important part of the Christmas Mass. Carols are traditional songs that celebrate Christmas themes such as family, peace, love, and joy. They often tell stories or recount traditional legends about Santa Claus or Jesus’ birth.</p>
<p>The sermon is an important part of any Catholic Mass. It is typically delivered by a priest or minister and is meant to explicate the readings and explain their significance for believers. The sermon for a Christmas Mass usually focuses on the meaning of Christmas itself: celebrating Jesus’ birth as a sign of hope for all people.</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-the-feast-of-the-Epiphany-rather-than-Christmas-considered-the-official-end-of-the-Christmas-season"><a href="#Why-is-the-feast-of-the-Epiphany-rather-than-Christmas-considered-the-official-end-of-the-Christmas-season" class="headerlink" title="Why is the feast of the Epiphany, rather than Christmas, considered the official end of the Christmas season?"></a>Why is the feast of the Epiphany, rather than Christmas, considered the official end of the Christmas season?</h1><p>The Christmas season is considered to officially end on January 6, which is known as the Feast of the Epiphany. This day celebrates the arrival of the wise men, also known as the Magi, who came to visit Jesus soon after his birth. The day is significant because it marks the official recognition of Jesus as the Messiah by outsiders. As such, many Christians see it as a more important holiday than Christmas.</p>
<h1 id="What-special-decorations-and-symbols-are-used-to-represent-the-Christmas-season-in-a-Catholic-church"><a href="#What-special-decorations-and-symbols-are-used-to-represent-the-Christmas-season-in-a-Catholic-church" class="headerlink" title="What special decorations and symbols are used to represent the Christmas season in a Catholic church?"></a>What special decorations and symbols are used to represent the Christmas season in a Catholic church?</h1><p>Many people think that the Christmas season begins with Thanksgiving and ends with New Year’s Day, but in the Catholic Church, the Christmas season actually starts on December 8th and lasts until January 6th. This is because the Catholic Church celebrates not one, but twelve days of Christmas.</p>
<p>During this time, there are a few special decorations and symbols that are used in Catholic churches to represent the Christmas season. One of these is called a crèche, which is a display of the Nativity scene. This scene usually includes a manger, Mary, Joseph, Baby Jesus, shepherds, and angels.</p>
<p>Another common symbol during the Christmas season is the Advent wreath. This wreath has four purple candles and one pink candle. The purple candles are lit during the weeks leading up to Christmas, while the pink candle is lit on Christmas day.</p>
<p>Finally, another common decoration during the Christmas season is a nativity scene. This scene usually includes Baby Jesus, Mary, Joseph, shepherds, and angels.</p>
