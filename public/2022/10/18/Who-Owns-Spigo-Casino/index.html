        <h1 id="Who-Owns-Spigo-Casino"><a href="#Who-Owns-Spigo-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Who Owns Spigo Casino?"></a>Who Owns Spigo Casino?</h1><p>Spigo casino is a subsidiary of a Swedish holding company, Spil AB. The company has ownership interests in several other gaming and entertainment businesses, including an online casino, a bingo site, and a number of other gaming-related operations.</p>
<p>The Spil Group was founded in 2001 by entrepreneurs Christer and Daniel Larsson. The brothers had previous experience in the online gaming industry and were looking to create their own business. The company launched its first online casino in 2002. This was followed by the launch of several other gaming products over the years.</p>
<p>Spil AB is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. The company has about 500 employees across its various businesses. In addition to Spigo casino, the group also owns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Betsafe, an online casino and sports betting site</li>
<li>Bingo24, a Swedish bingo site</li>
<li>CasinoEuro, an online casino with operations across Europe</li>
<li>Scandiccasino, an online casino focused on the Scandinavian market</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Gambling-Establishment-Spigo-Casino-Owners-Revealed"><a href="#Gambling-Establishment-Spigo-Casino-Owners-Revealed" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Establishment Spigo Casino Owners Revealed"></a>Gambling Establishment Spigo Casino Owners Revealed</h1><p>The Norwegian Gaming Board has released the names of the owners of Spigo Casino, a gambling establishment licensed in Malta. The owners are revealed to be two companies, Jota Partners and Trio Invest, both based in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Jota Partners is registered in Geneva and is owned by three Swedish entrepreneurs, Stefan Ingves, Christer Gardell and Mats Carlsson. Trio Invest is registered in Zug and is owned by two British entrepreneurs, Mick Davis and Tony Buckingham.</p>
<p>This news comes as a surprise to many in the industry since it was generally believed that the owner of Spingo Casino was a Maltese company called Intralot. It is not yet clear what the relationship between Jota Partners&#x2F;Trio Invest and Intralot is, but it is possible that Intralot provides technical support to Spigo Casino.</p>
<p>Spigo Casino has been operational for about two years and has so far generated about €4 million in revenue. The Norwegian Gaming Board has imposed a number of conditions on Spigo Casino’s license, including a requirement that the owners be made public.</p>
<h1 id="Who’s-Behind-Spigo-Casino"><a href="#Who’s-Behind-Spigo-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Who’s Behind Spigo Casino?"></a>Who’s Behind Spigo Casino?</h1><p>With so many online casinos to choose from, it can be hard to decide which one is right for you. If you’re looking for an online casino that is reputable and has a good selection of games, Spigo Casino is a great choice. But who is behind this casino?</p>
<p>Spigo Casino is operated by two companies - Spigo AS and Yggdrasil Gaming. Spigo AS is a Norwegian company that was founded in 2006. Yggdrasil Gaming is a Swedish company that was founded in 2013. Both companies are well-known for their high-quality online casino games.</p>
<p>Spigo Casino offers a wide variety of games, including slots, table games, and live dealer games. You can also find some unique games at this casino, such as TV shows and movies themed slots. Plus, there are always new games being added to the lineup.</p>
<p>One of the things that sets Spigo Casino apart from other casinos is its customer support. The customer support team is available 24&#x2F;7 via email, phone, or chat and they are always happy to help. They can help with anything from account questions to technical issues.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a reliable online casino with a great selection of games, Spigo Casino is a great choice.</p>
<h1 id="The-Owner-of-Spigo-Casino-is…"><a href="#The-Owner-of-Spigo-Casino-is…" class="headerlink" title="The Owner of Spigo Casino is…?"></a>The Owner of Spigo Casino is…?</h1><p>Björn Åkesson, the founder and majority owner of Spigo casino is an entrepreneur who has made a name for himself in the online gambling industry. He is the CEO and founder of one of Europe’s largest online gambling companies, Beterbingo, which he founded in 2001. Björn Åkesson also has a background in software development and was one of the pioneers in developing internet bingo games.</p>
<h1 id="mystery-surrounding-ownership-of-Spigo-Casino"><a href="#mystery-surrounding-ownership-of-Spigo-Casino" class="headerlink" title="mystery surrounding ownership of Spigo Casino"></a>mystery surrounding ownership of Spigo Casino</h1><p>In 2010, a Spigo Casino was founded in Sweden. Spigo is an online gaming company that offers casino games, poker, and bingo to its customers. The company is headquartered in Stockholm and majority-owned by the investment firm Bonnier. In March of this year, however, the ownership of Spigo changed hands.</p>
<p>Bonnier announced that it had agreed to sell Spigo to an unknown party for an undisclosed amount. This news was surprising to many in the industry, as Bonnier had been one of the only investors in Spigo and had been with the company since its inception. No reason was given for the sale, and the new owners of Spigo have remained anonymous.</p>
<p>Since the sale, there has been much speculation as to who bought Spigo and what their plans for the company are. Some believe that an American gaming company may have bought Spigo in order to expand into Europe. Others believe that a rival gaming company may have purchased Spigo in order to gain a foothold in the Swedish market.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons for the sale may be, it is clear that there is a lot of mystery surrounding it. The new owners of Spigo have not made any statements about their plans for the company and have refused to comment on the sale whatsoever. This has left many people wondering what will happen to Spigo under new ownership. Only time will tell what comes of this enigmatic purchase</p>
