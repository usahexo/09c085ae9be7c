Bond has been ordering his martinis this way since 1954, when author Ian Fleming first mentioned it in his book “Diamonds are Forever.”</p>
<p>So why does Bond order his martinis shaken and not stirred? Some say it’s because stirring can bruise the gin, but others believe that Fleming chose the phrase as a sly nod to the homosexual underworld of London at that time. The true reason may never be known, but one thing is for sure - Bond’s shaken martini is now an iconic part of cinema history.</p>
<h1 id="Liga-Nos"><a href="#Liga-Nos" class="headerlink" title="Liga Nos!"></a>Liga Nos!</h1><p>The Portuguese top flight is one of the most exciting in Europe and always produces thrilling title races. Below we take a look at the contenders for this season’s crown.</p>
<p>FC Porto</p>
<p>The Dragons have been the most consistent side over the past few seasons and will be looking to make it a fourth league title in a row. They have strengthened their squad with the signings of Brahimi and Herrera, both of whom should help them in their quest for silverware. However, they could face a stiff challenge from rivals Benfica and Sporting Lisbon.</p>
<p>SL Benfica</p>
<p>The Eagles finished as runners-up last season and will be determined to go one better this time around. They have made some quality additions to their squad, most notably Durmisi and Mitroglou, and will be confident of mounting a serious challenge to FC Porto.</p>

<p>Sporting CP</p>
<p>The Lions have been rebuilding since they sold Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus and they will be looking to make an impact in the league this season. Bruno Fernandes has been brought in from Udinese to bolster their midfield and he could prove to be a key player for them. They will be hoping to mount a serious title challenge but may struggle against the two teams above them.</p>
<h1 id="2-Could-James-Bond’s-next-drink-order-be-a-beer-in-Casino-Royale-Liga-Nos"><a href="#2-Could-James-Bond’s-next-drink-order-be-a-beer-in-Casino-Royale-Liga-Nos" class="headerlink" title="2. Could James Bond’s next drink order be a beer in Casino Royale Liga Nos?"></a>2. Could James Bond’s next drink order be a beer in Casino Royale Liga Nos?</h1><p>For the first time in the James Bond series, 007 orders a beer in Casino Royale Liga Nos. Will this be a new trend for the secret agent?</p>
<p>When Daniel Craig made his debut as James Bond in 2006’s Casino Royale, he ordered a vodka martini shaken, not stirred. But in last year’s Spectre, Craig’s Bond ordered a lager from the bar at the casino in Montenegro. While some may see this as a sign that Bond is mellowing with age, beer drinker and culture writer Maggie Hennessy sees it as an interesting indicator of regional preferences.</p>
<p>“In Portugal, beer is considered a very macho drink,” Hennessy said in an interview with The Drinks Business. “It’s something that men order in bars and at football matches.” She added that Bond’s preference for a lager over other types of alcohol could be seen as a nod to the country’s national sport: football (soccer).</p>
<p>Bond’s decision to order a beer may have been influenced by actor Daniel Craig, who is originally from Liverpool, England. Liverpool is known for its love of football and its strong brewing traditions. The city has more than 50 breweries, many of which are small and family-owned. In fact, Liverpool was named European Capital of Culture for 2008 partly because of its vibrant music and nightlife scene, but also because of its thriving beer industry.</p>
<p>So could James Bond’s next drink order be a beer? It’s definitely possible. And if he does order a beer again, we can probably expect it to be from a brewery in Liverpool or one of Portugal’s Liga Nos football stadiums.</p>

Bond opts for a whisky sour in Casino Royale Liga Nos instead of his trademark martini!"></a>3. Bond opts for a whisky sour in Casino Royale Liga Nos instead of his trademark martini!</h1><p>007 -a.k.a. Bond- is a legendary British secret agent who has a preference for martinis. In the 2006 movie “Casino Royale” however, Bond surprisingly orders a whisky sour instead of his customary martini!</p>
<p>Whisky sours are cocktails made with whisky, lemon juice, sugar and egg whites. The drink is shaken with ice and strained into a glass.</p>
<p>Bond’s decision to order a whisky sour may have been influenced by Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green), who requests one in the film. Vesper is 007’s love interest in the movie and she probably persuaded him to try the drink.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the whisky sour was actually first mixed in 1806 by bartender Johnnie Walker at the now-defunct prestigious Covent Garden Theatre in London! It soon became popular among theatre-goers as a refreshing drink that could help them cool down during hot summer nights.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Will you be giving whisky sours a try?</p>
<h1 id="4-Will-James-Bond-order-a-vodka-tonic-in-Casino-Royale-Liga-Nos"><a href="#4-Will-James-Bond-order-a-vodka-tonic-in-Casino-Royale-Liga-Nos" class="headerlink" title="4. Will James Bond order a vodka tonic in Casino Royale Liga Nos?"></a>4. Will James Bond order a vodka tonic in Casino Royale Liga Nos?</h1><p>In Casino Royale (2006), James Bond orders a vodka tonic from the casino bar. This marked a departure from previous films in the series, where Bond typically ordered Martinis. However, will he order the same drink in Liga Nos?</p>
<p>There is no definitive answer, as it will likely depend on the specific scene and location. For example, if Bond is in a more traditional Portuguese setting, such as a Lisbon casino, it’s likely that he would order a Gin Tonic instead of a vodka tonic. However, if he is in an American-style casino, such as the one in Macau, he may well order a vodka tonic again.</p>
<p>Whatever drink Bond orders, one thing is for sure – it will be perfectly mixed and served with style!</p>

Will we see any new drinks orders from James Bond in Casino Royale Liga Nos?"></a>5. Will we see any new drinks orders from James Bond in Casino Royale Liga Nos?</h1><p>Casino Royale Liga Nos is one of the most anticipated movies of the year. The film is set to be released in November 2017 and is already creating a lot of buzz. One of the things that viewers are most excited about is how new drinks orders from James Bond will be incorporated into the movie.</p>
<p>There have been a number of reports that suggest that Bond will be ordering different drinks in Casino Royale Liga Nos than he has done in past movies. In fact, it has even been rumored that some of the drinks orders will be based on Portuguese cocktails. This should make for an interesting addition to the movie and could add an extra level of authenticity to it.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how these new drinks orders from James Bond are implemented into Casino Royale Liga Nos. Hopefully, they will add something fresh to the movie and help to enhance the overall experience for viewers.</p>
