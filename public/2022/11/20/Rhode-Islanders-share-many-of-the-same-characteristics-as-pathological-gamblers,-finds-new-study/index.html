<p>The study, which was conducted by researchers at Brown University, surveyed 902 Rhode Islanders and asked them about their gambling habits. The results showed that 15% of those surveyed could be considered pathological gamblers, and that they shared a number of common characteristics, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling out of control while gambling</li>
<li>Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when not gambling</li>
<li>Gambling to escape problems or negative emotions</li>
</ul>
<p>“These findings suggest that there may be a need for targeted prevention and treatment interventions for pathological gamblers in Rhode Island,” said lead author Dr. Stephanie Mlot.</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-ranks-high-in-gambling-addiction-rates"><a href="#Rhode-Island-ranks-high-in-gambling-addiction-rates" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island ranks high in gambling addiction rates"></a>Rhode Island ranks high in gambling addiction rates</h1><p>A study by WalletHub ranks Rhode Island as the 10th most gambling addicted state in the US. The study looked at how addicted states were to gambling overall, as well as to specific forms of gambling such as casinos, lottery, and race betting.</p>
<p>Rhode Island performed well in all categories, but particularly in casino addiction rates, where it ranked 6th worst in the nation. This is consistent with other studies that have shown Rhode Island to have one of the highest rates of problem and pathological gambling in the country.</p>
<p>There are a number of possible explanations for this high rate of addiction. One is that Rhode Island has more casinos than any other state except Nevada. This gives residents easy access to gambling, and may make them more likely to develop a problem.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation is that Rhode Islanders are particularly prone to addictive behaviors. This could be due to genetic or environmental factors, or simply to the fact that there is a lot of temptation to gamble in the state.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons for Rhode Island’s high addiction rate, it is clear that there is a serious problem here. If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling addiction, there are resources available to help you get treatment.</p>
<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling offers a hotline (1-800-522-4700) and online chat service for people who need help dealing with their addiction. There are also a number of local support groups available throughout the state.</p>
<h1 id="Pathological-gambling-more-common-than-previously-thought"><a href="#Pathological-gambling-more-common-than-previously-thought" class="headerlink" title="Pathological gambling more common than previously thought"></a>Pathological gambling more common than previously thought</h1><p>Pathological gambling, also known as compulsive gambling, is a problem that affects millions of people in the United States. It is more common than many people think, and it can cause a lot of damage to relationships, financial stability, and mental health.</p>
<p>Pathological gambling is a type of addiction. People with this addiction feel an intense need to gamble, even when they know it is not good for them. They may lose control over their gambling habits, betting more money than they can afford or continuing to gamble even after they have lost a lot of money.</p>
<p>People with pathological gambling often feel ashamed and embarrassed about their addiction. They may keep it hidden from friends and family members, which can make it difficult to get help.</p>
<p>Pathological gambling can have serious consequences for the person with the addiction and for their loved ones. It can lead to financial problems, relationship issues, and mental health problems such as depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>If you think you or someone you know might have a problem with pathological gambling, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available for people who struggle with this addiction, including support groups, therapy, and medication. With treatment, most people are able to overcome pathological gambling and regain control of their lives.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-takes-heavy-toll-on-Rhode-Islanders"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-takes-heavy-toll-on-Rhode-Islanders" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction takes heavy toll on Rhode Islanders"></a>Gambling addiction takes heavy toll on Rhode Islanders</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a problem that often goes unrecognized and untreated in Rhode Island, taking a heavy toll on individuals, families and communities.</p>
<p>According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, about two percent of the population experiences gambling addiction, also known as pathological gambling. However, this percentage is likely much higher in Rhode Island, which has one of the highest rates of gambling addiction in the country.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have devastating consequences for individuals and families. Pathological gamblers often experience financial ruin as a result of their addiction, and may even resort to criminal behavior in order to get money to gamble. They also tend to suffer from depression and other mental health issues.</p>
<p>The effects of gambling addiction are not limited to the individual, however. Families often bear the brunt of the impact of pathological gambling, with spouses and children subjected to verbal abuse, physical violence and financial instability. Communities also suffer when pathological gamblers commit crimes or become homeless due to their addiction.</p>
<p>Despite the clear evidence that gambling addiction wreaks havoc on individuals and families, there is little help available for those affected in Rhode Island. There are no state-funded programs specifically for gambling addiction, and very few resources available at the local level. This leaves people struggling with gambling addiction on their own to deal with what can be a very difficult problem.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are some things that can be done to address this issue. The first step is increasing awareness about gambling addiction and its negative effects. Families and communities need to know that help is available for those affected by this problem. Secondly, more resources need to be made available for those who struggle with gambling addiction. This could include funding for state-funded programs or increased access to treatment options at the local level. Finally, it is important to destigmatize gambling addiction so that people feel comfortable seeking help when they need it.</p>
<p>Addressing the problem of gambling addiction in Rhode Island will not be easy, but it is essential if we want to improve the lives of those affected by this devastating problem</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Islanders-struggle-with-gambling-addiction"><a href="#Rhode-Islanders-struggle-with-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Islanders struggle with gambling addiction"></a>Rhode Islanders struggle with gambling addiction</h1><p>Rhode Islanders are no stranger to gambling. The state is home to one of the largest casino resorts in the world, Twin River Casino. And with more than $2 billion wagered each year, it’s no wonder that Rhode Island also ranks among the states with the highest rates of problem and pathological gambling.</p>
<p>According to The National Council on Problem Gambling, an estimated 2-3 percent of adults in the U.S. – or approximately 6 million people – meet the criteria for problem gambling. In Rhode Island, that number is even higher, with an estimated 4-5 percent of adults affected.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for individuals and their families. Financial difficulties, job loss, and marital problems are some of the most common consequences of gambling addiction. But there can also be serious psychological consequences, including depression, anxiety, and even suicide.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. The National Council on Problem Gambling provides information on how to find help in your area, as well as resources for loved ones of gamblers.</p>
