        <h1 id="ACF-Fiorentina-Scores-Late-Winner-in-Opener-at-Caesars-Windsor"><a href="#ACF-Fiorentina-Scores-Late-Winner-in-Opener-at-Caesars-Windsor" class="headerlink" title="ACF Fiorentina Scores Late Winner in Opener at Caesars Windsor"></a>ACF Fiorentina Scores Late Winner in Opener at Caesars Windsor</h1><p>ACF Fiorentina found the back of the net in the waning minutes to secure a 3-2 victory over hosts, Caesars Windsor, Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The Italian side, who competed in Serie A last season and finished in 7th place just outside of European qualification, looked lively from the get-go at Caesars Windsor Stadium. La Viola were led by Uruguayan forward, Luis Muriel, who tallied a goal and an assist on the night.</p>
<p>Muriel narrowly missed scoring in the 6th minute when his shot from close range rang off the post. However, he would not be kept out for long as he opened up the scoring in the 15th minute with a neat finish into the bottom corner after being put through on goal by Cyril Thereau.</p>
<p>Caesars Windsor equalized shortly thereafter through Brazilian midfielder Lucas Venuto, but Muriel restored Fiorentina’s lead before halftime with a well-placed header off a cross from Marco Benassi.</p>
<p>The home side came out firing in the second half and managed to pull level again in the 55th minute when Stefan Mitrovic headed home a cross from Ryan Telfer. However, it was Venuto who had the last laugh as he set up Muriel for his second goal of the game to give ACF Fiorentina all three points in their opener.</p>
<h1 id="Early-Lead-Not-Enough-as-ACF-Fiorentina-Falls-to-Columbus-Crew-SC"><a href="#Early-Lead-Not-Enough-as-ACF-Fiorentina-Falls-to-Columbus-Crew-SC" class="headerlink" title="Early Lead Not Enough as ACF Fiorentina Falls to Columbus Crew SC"></a>Early Lead Not Enough as ACF Fiorentina Falls to Columbus Crew SC</h1><p>ACF Fiorentina were handed their second consecutive defeat in North America on Wednesday night, as Columbus Crew SC claimed a 3-1 victory at MAPFRE Stadium. Federico Chiesa’s early goal was not enough to prevent the Viola from slipping to their fourth pre-season defeat.</p>
<p>Both sides fielded strong lineups, with fittnesstested newcomers taking to the field for both clubs. For Columbus, midfield playmaker Wil Trapp made his first appearance of the pre-season after returning from USMNT duty, while new signing Milton Valenzuela started at left-back.</p>
<p>ACF Fiorentina went ahead after just six minutes courtesy of a wellexecuted free kick from Chiesa. The 20year-old curled the ball over the wall and into the top corner of the net, leaving goalkeeper Zack Steffen with no chance.</p>
<p>The home side responded positively to going behind and began to control proceedings. They equalized in controversial fashion on 17 minutes, as Gyasi Zardes bundled the ball over the line after goalkeeper Lafont had saved his initial header from close range. Replays showed that Zardes had clearly pushed defender Nikola Milenkovic before scoring, but nonetheless the goal was allowed to stand.</p>
<p>Columbus took the lead for real ten minutes later, as Harrison Afful’s cross was headed in by Josh Williams at the back post. The Crew SC captain then made it 3-1 with a well taken free kick in firsthalf stoppage time, giving his side a deserved win in front of their home fans. </p>
<p>With two defeats from their two games in North America so far, ACF Fiorentina will be keen to improve ahead of next week’s return leg against Columbus Crew SC.</p>

After conceding an early goal, the Lions roared back with a goal of their own to earn a hard-fought point.</p>
<p>The Italian side started the match well and were rewarded in the 8th minute. A well-worked free-kick resulted in Khouma Babacar getting on the end of a low ball across the face of goal to slide it past Joe Bendik for the opener.</p>
<p>Orlando City slowly grew into the match and began to create chances. In the 34th minute, Venezuelan international Jefferson Savarino hit a powerful effort from outside the box that was well saved by Alban Lafont in the Fiorentina net.</p>
<p>The home side finally broke through in the 39th minute when Dom Dwyer pounced on a loose ball inside the area and slotted it home to level things up going into halftime.</p>
<p>The second half saw both sides create chances but neither could find a winner. debutant Justin Meram came close for Orlando when he rattled the crossbar in stoppage time after being played through by Sacha Kljestan.</p>
<p>Overall, it was an encouraging performance from Orlando City against a strong Fiorentina side. The draw leaves them unbeaten in pre-season so far with one win and two draws. Up next for them is Liga MX side Club Tijuana on Saturday, Feb 24th at 7:30pm EST.</p>

<p>The hosts opened the scoring in the 18th minute, as Ignacio Piatti latched onto a ball over the top from Blerim Dzemaili and slotted it past goalkeeper Marco Sportiello. </p>
<p>Montreal doubled their lead in the 38th minute, with Michael Petrasso curling home a superb free kick after being fouled on the edge of the box. </p>
<p>Fiorentina pulled one back nine minutes into the second half through German Pezzella, but Montreal restored their two-goal cushion in the 67th minute through Dzemaili, who finished off a fine team move. </p>
<p>The Impact added a fourth goal in injury time, as substitute Anthony Jackson-Hamel bundled home from close range to seal an impressive win for Montreal. </p>
<p>It was an excellent start to the season for Remi Garde’s side, who will now hope to continue their good form when they travel to Philadelphia Union next weekend.</p>
