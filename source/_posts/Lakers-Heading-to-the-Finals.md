#  Lakers Heading to the Finals?

Just when it looked like the Lakers were cooked, they put together a streak of impressive victories that has them in position to make a run at the NBA Finals.

Led by LeBron James, the Lakers have reemerged as a contender in the Western Conference. They’ve now won six of their last seven games and appear to be hitting their stride at just the right time.

If they can keep up this momentum, they’ll be a tough team to beat in the playoffs. With James on their side, anything is possible.

The Lakers still have some work to do before they clinch a playoff berth, but they’re certainly headed in the right direction. Keep an eye on this team down the stretch – they could be playing in the Finals later this year.

#  Lakers on a Hot Streak After Run Line Win

The Lakers have won their last four games and they are looking like a team that is on a hot streak. The Lakers have not been playing very well in the past, but they seem to have turned things around. This could be a sign of things to come for the Lakers, who are looking to make the playoffs this season.

One of the reasons for the Lakers' recent success has been their play on the run line. In their last four games, the Lakers have gone 4-0 against the run line. This means that they have been winning by more than six points per game, which is impressive.

The Lakers will need to continue this momentum as they head into their next game against the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors are one of the best teams in the NBA, so this will be a tough test for the Lakers. However, if they can continue to play well and win by big margins, they should be able to take down the Warriors.

#  Lakers Continue Their Dominance With Run Line Victory

The Lakers opened as 4.5-point favorites at home against the Nets and easily covered the spread with a 119-83 victory. Los Angeles has now won seven consecutive games and is 11-4 SU and 10-4 ATS during that stretch.

The Lakers got another great performance from LeBron James, who had 28 points, eight rebounds, and six assists. Kyrie Irving added 21 points and eight assists, while Anthony Davis chipped in 20 points and 11 rebounds.

Brooklyn was led by Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert, who had 19 points apiece. The Nets have now lost five consecutive games and are just 2-8 SU and 3-7 ATS over their last 10 contests.

Los Angeles played excellent defense once again, holding Brooklyn to just 36% shooting from the field. The Lakers have now allowed fewer than 100 points in six of their last seven games.

With this victory, the Lakers improve to 27-10 overall and 14-5 at home. They remain in first place in the Western Conference standings, 1.5 games ahead of the Nuggets.

Next up for Los Angeles is a road game against the Rockets on Thursday night.

#  Another Win for the Lakers Thanks to the Run Line

Monday night, the Lakers faced another winnable game against the lowly Suns. With just over two minutes left in the fourth quarter and the Lakers up 104-96, it looked like they would coast to an easy victory.

However, over the next minute and a half, the Suns went on an 8-0 run to tie up the game at 104. In the final seconds of regulation, Julius Randle put back a missed three-pointer by Lonzo Ball to give the Lakers a 106-104 lead and send the game into overtime.

In OT, it was all Lakers. They outscored Phoenix 16-8 to win 122-110 and cover the +7.5 point spread. It was their second win in a row and moved them ahead of the Utah Jazz for ninth place in the Western Conference playoff race.

It was another impressive victory for Los Angeles, but it didn't come without some controversy. Late in OT, LeBron James appeared to foul Devin Booker on a three-point attempt, but no foul was called and Booker made all three free throws to trim Phoenix's deficit to six points.

It's hard not to feel that James was fouled on that play, but he put it behind him and helped clinch the victory for his team. "I don't know if I got fouled or not," said James after the game. "It doesn't matter."

The Lakers will look to keep their momentum going when they take on the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night.

#  Another Close Victory by the Lakers With Help From the Run Line

The Lakers have been a streaky team this year. In their first 33 games, they managed to win 20 and lose 13. In their last 33 games, they've improved with a 27-6 record. So far in their current 7 game winning streak, they've played inconsistently - beating the Knicks by only 2 points and the Pelicans by 14, while blowing out the Cavaliers and Thunder by over 30 points each.

Looking at how they've won these past few games though might give some insight into how this Lakers team could make a deep playoff run. Almost all of these wins were close ones that were won with help from the run line. The Knicks game was an exception where the Lakers were blown out in the first half but made a furious comeback in the second to win by 2.

In the Cavaliers game, LeBron James sat out injured and the Lakers blew out Cleveland for their largest margin of victory in the winning streak. In their game against Oklahoma City however, it was clear that James was back and he led the team to victory with 34 points, 9 assists, and 5 rebounds. This was also a close game - with the Lakers entering halftime down by 5 but coming back in the 3rd quarter to take control of the game and win going away.

What does this mean for the Lakers? It means that they can win even when LeBron isn't playing his best ball. They showed this against New Orleans when James had only 15 points but 11 assists and 10 rebounds - leading them to victory anyway. This is important because it proves that they can win even when one of their star players isn't playing his best or is injured.

One other factor that has been key in these past few games is defense. The Lakers have been excellent on defense lately, holding teams like Cleveland and Oklahoma City to significantly lower scoring totals than usual. If they can continue to play lockdown defense while LeBron gets back into form offensively, they could be very tough opponents for any team in the playoffs.
