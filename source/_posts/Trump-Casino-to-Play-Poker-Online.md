# Trump Casino to Play Poker Online

In a statement released earlier this week, Donald Trump announced that the Trump Casino will be getting into the online poker market. This move is seen as a way to compete with other casinos that have been successful in the space.

"We are excited to enter the online poker market," said Eric Trump, executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the Trump Organization. "We believe our brand and our customer base will be a big success in this space."

The Trump Casino has already partnered with PokerStars, one of the world's largest operators of online poker rooms. The two companies will be working together to create a new site that will offer real-money poker games to players around the world.

The site is expected to launch in early 2017, and it will offer both cash games and tournaments. Players will be able to access the site from their computers or mobile devices, making it easy for them to play whenever they want.

The Trump Casino is not the only casino operator getting into the online poker market. Caesars Entertainment Corporation has also announced plans to launch an online poker site early next year. That site will be called WSOP.com and it will offer players access to all of Caesars' properties around the world.

Online poker has become increasingly popular in recent years, and it is now estimated that there are more than 25 million people playing regularly. That number is expected to grow even larger in the coming years, as more people learn about the benefits of playing online.

For casino operators, entering the online poker market makes sense because it allows them to tap into a new audience of players. These players may not visit traditional casinos, but they are interested in playing poker online. By offering a quality product, casino operators can attract these players and hopefully create some loyal customers.

It is understood that the app will initially be available to players in the United States, with a global rollout planned for later in the year.

# PokerStars partnership with TrumpCasino.com

On Tuesday, PokerStars announced a partnership with TrumpCasino.com, a new online casino that is set to launch in the coming weeks. This is the first time PokerStars has partnered with an online casino, and it is yet another sign of the company's expanding presence in the iGaming market.

TrumpCasino.com is owned by The Trump Organization, which is headed by real estate mogul Donald Trump. In a press release, PokerStars said that the partnership will give its players access to "a comprehensive suite of online casino games."

"The Trump Organization is a world-class organization and we are thrilled to be partnering with them," said Eric Hollreiser, PR Director for PokerStars.

Our goal at TrumpCasino.com is to provide our players with the best possible gaming experience, and I know that with PokerStars on board, we're well on our way to achieving that."

The launch of TrumpCasino.com will come just weeks after Amaya Gaming completed its purchase of PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker. That acquisition made Amaya the world's largest online poker company, and it seems clear that the company plans to use PokerStars' brand power to expand into other areas of iGaming.
