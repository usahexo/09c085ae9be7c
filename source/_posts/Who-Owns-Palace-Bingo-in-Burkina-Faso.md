#  Who Owns Palace Bingo in Burkina Faso?

Palace Bingo is a Burkina Faso-based gaming company that has been in operation since 2009. The company offers a range of casino games, including slots, roulette, blackjack, and poker, as well as bingo. Palace Bingo is one of the most popular gaming companies in the country, and has seen significant growth in recent years.

So who owns Palace Bingo? That's a bit of a mystery. The company is privately owned, and its ownership is not publicly disclosed. However, there are some clues about who may be behind the business.

In 2012, Palace Bingo was acquired by Bingu International, a holding company based in London. Bingu International is reportedly owned by an individual named Mamadou Traore. Traore is also the owner of several other businesses in Burkina Faso, including a hotel chain and a media company. It's unclear whether Traore has any involvement in running Palace Bingo himself or if he simply owns the company outright.

#  The Owner of Palace Bingo in Burkina Faso is 
The latest headlines regarding the owner of Palace Bingo in Burkina Faso are that he has come into some money and is looking to invest in new businesses. The Head of the National Lottery Commission has confirmed that the owner, Abdoulaye Sawadogo, is the new majority shareholder in their company. This news comes as a surprise to many, as it was thought that Sawadogo was a poor man who barely had enough money to run his bingo hall. It turns out that he was simply smart with his money and invested wisely.

Sawadogo first opened Palace Bingo in 1992 and it has been a success ever since. He has always been a shrewd businessman, and it is this mentality that has helped him amass his new fortune. He is not someone who is afraid to take risks, either – which is why he decided to invest in the lottery commission. This is a high-risk investment, but if Sawadogo can help turn the commission around then he will make a lot of money.

He is not the only one who stands to benefit from this investment; the people of Burkina Faso will also see some rewards. The lottery commission has been struggling for years, but with Sawadogo at the helm it looks like things are about to change for the better. Not only will there be more jobs available, but the commission will also be able to generate more revenue for the government. This money will be used to fund important projects such as healthcare and education.

So far, there hasn’t been any word on how much Sawadogo paid for his stake in the lottery commission. However, it is safe to say that he didn’t do it out of the kindness of his heart; he stands to make a lot of money if things go well. That being said, there is no reason why they won’t go well – Sawadogo is a smart man with a lot of experience in business. He knows what he’s doing and I’m sure he will be successful in turning the lottery commission around.
