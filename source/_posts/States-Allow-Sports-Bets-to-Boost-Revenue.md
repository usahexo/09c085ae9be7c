#  States Allow Sports Bets to Boost Revenue

Since the Supreme Court repealed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May of 2018, several states have moved forward to allow for sports betting. The act essentially prohibited state-authorized sports gambling with a few exceptions. It was passed in 1992 and helped lead to the demise of Atlantic City as a major casino hub.

New Jersey was the state that brought the lawsuit against the federal government that eventually led to PASPA’s repeal. Governor Phil Murphy has since moved forward with regulations that would allow sports betting at casinos, racetracks, and online within New Jersey’s borders.

Murphy is not alone in his efforts; many other state governments are looking to take advantage of the Supreme Court’s decision. Some states, like Illinois, are still in the planning phases, while others, like Pennsylvania and West Virginia, have already begun taking bets.

It is estimated that sports betting could generate up to $7 billion in annual revenue for states. This would be a major windfall for cash-strapped state governments and could help offset some of the budget cuts seen in recent years.

There are some who are concerned about the negative social effects of expanded sports betting, but most experts believe that it will be largely regulated and won’t lead to any significant increase in gambling addiction or other social problems.

Allowing for sports betting is a way for states to generate new revenue without raising taxes. It also has the potential to create jobs in the gaming industry. While there may be some initial costs associated with setting up systems for accepting sports bets, these are likely to be minimal in comparison to the potential revenue gains.

State governments should move quickly to take advantage of this opportunity and begin implementing regulations that will allow for sports betting within their borders.

#  States Allow Sports Bets to Combat Illegal Gambling


As the legalization of sports betting spreads throughout the United States, officials in many states are hopeful that it will help combat illegal gambling. In Nevada, where sports betting has been legal for years, officials say that the vast majority of sports betting is done through legal channels.

"We have an excellent gaming regulatory system in this state that protect consumers and ensure the integrity of contests," said A.G. Burnett, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board. "That system has been in place for many years and has worked well."

New Jersey is among the states that have legalized sports betting in recent months. Officials there say they are also expecting a large portion of sports betting to take place through legal channels.

"Our casinos and racetracks are very well-equipped to handle sports betting," said David Rebuck, director of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. "And we have regulations in place that will protect consumers and ensure the integrity of games."

Pennsylvania is another state that recently legalized sports betting, and officials there are also expecting a significant portion of bets to be placed through legal channels.

"Pennsylvania's casino industry is well-prepared to offer sports betting, and we have strong regulations in place to ensure the integrity of games," said Anne Schwartz, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. "We anticipate that most bets will be placed through our licensed casinos."

Officials in other states that have legalized sports betting, including Mississippi and West Virginia, are also expecting a large percentage of bets to be placed through legal channels.

#  States Allow Sports Bets to Create Jobs

The legalization of sports betting in the United States is creating jobs in the states that allow it. The American Gaming Association (AGA) released a report last week that found that sports betting is creating jobs and investment opportunities across the country.

The AGA’s study found that New Jersey has created over 1,500 jobs since sports betting was legalized in June 2018. In Pennsylvania, there are now over 500 people employed in the industry, and that number is expected to grow as more casinos come online.

States like West Virginia and Rhode Island are also seeing a boost in employment thanks to sports betting legalization. In Rhode Island, there are now over 100 people working in the industry, while West Virginia has hired nearly 200 people.

Overall, the AGA’s report estimates that sports betting will create over 17,000 new jobs across the United States. This is in addition to the $4 billion in economic activity that will be generated by legal sports betting each year.

“This report underscores what we have known all along: legalizing and regulating sports betting creates economic opportunities for states and businesses,” said Geoff Freeman, President and CEO of the AGA. “It is clear from our findings that states where sports betting is legal are experiencing job growth and an influx of new investment. We look forward to working with state legislators and regulators to ensure these benefits are realized nationwide.”

Sports gambling has been illegal nationwide since 1992, when then-President George H.W. Bush signed into law the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). However, PASPA was ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court last year, opening the door for states to legalize sports betting.

Since then, 11 states have legalized some form of sports betting, with more likely to follow in the coming years. This is good news for unemployment rates across the country, as more jobs will be created in an industry that is rapidly growing.

#  States Allow Sports Bets to Improve Tourism

The legalization of sports betting in a number of states has done more than just improve the tourism industry, it has also generated considerable revenue for these states.

For example, in Nevada sports betting generated $1.5 billion in revenue in 2017. This accounted for almost 10 percent of the state’s total gaming revenue. In Delaware, sports betting was responsible for generating $10 million in revenue in its first full year following legalization. This amounted to nearly 2 percent of the state’s total gaming revenue. West Virginia experienced a similar trend, with sports betting accounting for 1.5 percent of the state’s total gaming revenue in its first year after legalization.

It is not just small states that are benefiting from sports betting; even larger states are seeing a significant influx of revenue. New Jersey, for example, generated over $380 million from sports betting in 2018, with over $300 million coming from online bets. This accounted for over 5 percent of the state’s total gaming revenue.

This increased revenue is not only a result of increased tourism but also because more people are now gambling on sports. A study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming found that approximately 33 million people in the United States would be interested in gambling on sports if it were legalized in their state. This is compared to the 16 million people who actually gambled on sports last year.

The fact that so many more people are interested in gambling on sports shows that there is a potential for significant growth in this industry. As more and more states legalize sports betting, it is likely that even more revenue will be generated for both the tourism industry and the states themselves.

#  States Allow Sports Bets Because They Are Legal

The state of New Jersey has been at the forefront of the sports betting debate. The state has been trying to legalize sports betting since 2011, and finally succeeded in 2018. New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, signed the bill into law that would allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state.

So why did New Jersey have to fight so hard for this right? And why are other states now looking to legalize sports betting? The answer lies in a Supreme Court case from 1992 called Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association.

In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could not prevent states from legalizing sports betting. This ruling opened the door for states to legalize sports betting if they wanted to.

Since then, a number of states have legalized some form of sports betting. Delaware, Nevada, New Mexico, and West Virginia all allow some form of sports betting. And more states are likely to follow suit now that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of New Jersey.

There are many reasons why states should legalize sports betting. For one, it would generate much-needed revenue for states. In New Jersey, for example, legal sports betting is expected to bring in over $200 million in revenue each year.

Another reason is that it would create jobs. The gambling industry is already a major employer, and legal sports betting would only add to that. In New Jersey alone, there could be up to 5,000 new jobs created by legal sports betting.

Legalizing sports betting is also good for consumers. It would keep people from gambling illegally and make sure that all gambling takes place in a safe and fair environment.

Ultimately, it is up to each individual state whether or not to legalize sports betting. But there are many good reasons for states to do so.
