#  Which Atlantic City Casino Pays Out the Most? 

Casinos in Atlantic City offer some of the best chances to win in the country. While there are a number of great casinos to choose from, some casinos do payout out more than others. So which Atlantic City casino pays out the most? 

There are a few different ways to answer this question. The first would be to look at the payout percentage for each casino. This is the percentage of money that a casino pays back to its players in winnings. The second way would be to look at how much each casino pays out in total wins. This would include both the amount won by players and the amount won by the casino. 

When looking at the payout percentage, we can see that Bally’s Casino has the highest payout percentage at 94.99%. This means that Bally’s pays out almost 95 cents on every dollar played. The lowest payout percentage is 89.51% which is held by Tropicana Casino & Resort. 

When looking at how much a casino pays out in total wins, we can see that Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa pays out the most with over $1 billion paid out since it opened in 2003. This is almost twice as much as any other casino in Atlantic City. Caesars Atlantic City comes in second place with over $500 million paid out, while Tropicana Casino & Resort comes in last with just over $300 million paid out. 

So while Bally’s has the best payout percentage, Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa pays out more money in total wins
