#  Mets Win Battle of the Casino Odds

The New York Mets closed as a +600 underdog at the sportsbooks in Las Vegas, but they managed to pull off the upset win against the Washington Nationals on Monday night.

The Nationals were favored by -700 at most of the sportsbooks, so the Mets’ victory was a major upset. New York won despite being outhit 16-8 and allowing six walks compared to just two for Washington.

Mets starter Steven Matz allowed four runs (three earned) over six innings of work, while five relievers combined to shutout the Nationals over the final three innings. Jay Bruce led the offense with three hits and two RBIs, while Yoenis Cespedes added two hits and an RBI of his own.

Washington starter Max Scherzer allowed three runs (two earned) over five innings, taking the loss despite striking out eight batters. Bryce Harper was 3-for-4 with an RBI and Michael A. Taylor added two hits for the Nationals.

The victory improves the Mets’ record to 71-74 on the season, while Washington falls to 91-50. With just 12 games remaining in their schedule, it is unlikely that New York will be able to catch up to Washington in the standings, but they can still play spoiler role over these last few weeks.
