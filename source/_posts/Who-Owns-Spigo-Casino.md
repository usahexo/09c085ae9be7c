#  mystery surrounding ownership of Spigo Casino

In 2010, a Spigo Casino was founded in Sweden. Spigo is an online gaming company that offers casino games, poker, and bingo to its customers. The company is headquartered in Stockholm and majority-owned by the investment firm Bonnier. In March of this year, however, the ownership of Spigo changed hands.

Bonnier announced that it had agreed to sell Spigo to an unknown party for an undisclosed amount. This news was surprising to many in the industry, as Bonnier had been one of the only investors in Spigo and had been with the company since its inception. No reason was given for the sale, and the new owners of Spigo have remained anonymous.

Since the sale, there has been much speculation as to who bought Spigo and what their plans for the company are. Some believe that an American gaming company may have bought Spigo in order to expand into Europe. Others believe that a rival gaming company may have purchased Spigo in order to gain a foothold in the Swedish market.

Whatever the reasons for the sale may be, it is clear that there is a lot of mystery surrounding it. The new owners of Spigo have not made any statements about their plans for the company and have refused to comment on the sale whatsoever. This has left many people wondering what will happen to Spigo under new ownership. Only time will tell what comes of this enigmatic purchase
