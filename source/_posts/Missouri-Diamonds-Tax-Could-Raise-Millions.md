#  Missouri Diamonds Tax Could Raise Millions

If Missouri lawmakers approve a proposal to levy a 10-percent tax on diamonds, the state could see an influx of more than $5 million in new tax revenue, according to officials.

The bill, sponsored by Democratic state Rep. Jake Hummel, would impose the levy on all diamonds sold in Missouri, regardless of value.

Hummel said the measure is needed to help close a $500 million budget shortfall.

"This is something that could generate up to $5 million for the state of Missouri," he said. "It's a tiny little tax on something that's not really going to affect people."

The proposal has drawn stiff opposition from the state's diamond industry, which employs about 1,200 people and generates more than $300 million in sales annually.

Mike Schlesinger, who owns two diamond stores in St. Louis, called the proposal a "job killer."

"This is absolutely ridiculous," he said. "It's going to drive business out of state and it's just going to cost jobs."

Others argue that the tax would simply be passed on to consumers.


The bill has yet to come up for a vote in the Missouri House of Representatives.

#  How Much Will Missouri Make in Diamond Tax Revenue?

In light of the recent diamond discovery in Boone County, Missouri officials are trying to determine how much the state will make in diamond tax revenue. The Boone County Assessor's office has stated that the value of the diamonds discovered is around $1 billion, and at a rate of 4%, Missouri could stand to make around $40 million in tax revenue.

That number could go up if larger diamonds are found or if the diamonds are sold overseas. Missouri Tax Commission spokeswoman Anne Marie Moy said that, "the important thing is that we get an idea of what this might mean for Missourians."

Some legislators are pushing for a higher tax rate on diamonds, but it's not clear yet what the final number will be. Boone County Presiding Commissioner Dan Atwill said that he is glad to see some money coming back to Boone County, but he also wants to make sure that all Missouri counties share in the wealth.

The diamond discovery is good news for Missouri, which has been suffering from budget cuts in recent years. This new revenue could help to offset some of those cuts and improve services for Missouri residents.

#  Missouri Amasses $1.5 Million in Diamond Tax Revenue

In March of 2018, Missouri generated over $1.5 million in diamond tax revenue. This news comes as a surprise to some, as diamonds have long been considered a “safe” investment. In recent years, the diamond market has experienced a resurgence, with investors turning to the precious stones as a way to ensure stability and growth.

This uptick in interest can be attributed, in part, to the diamond industry’s efforts to become more consumer-friendly. In recent years, the De Beers Group—one of the world’s largest diamond producers—has partnered with retailers like Macy’s and Walmart to offer customers a wide variety of diamonds at every price point. Additionally, the group has developed an online platform that allows consumers to select and purchase diamonds directly from De Beers.

The tax revenue collected in Missouri is a direct result of this renewed consumer interest. The vast majority of diamonds mined in Missouri are used in jewelry production, so it is not surprising that the state would generate significant revenue from taxes on these precious stones.

While it is unclear whether other states will follow Missouri’s lead and institute diamond taxes of their own, it is clear that the diamond industry is experiencing a resurgence. With investors looking for stable assets, diamonds are likely to remain popular for years to come.

#  Missouri Collects Nearly $2 Million in Diamond Tax Revenue

Last year, Missouri collected nearly $2 million in diamond tax revenue. The state imposed a 6% tax on the value of diamonds sold in Missouri, and the revenue generated from the tax was used to fund education programs.

The diamond tax was initially imposed in 2011, and it generated $1.5 million in revenue during its first year. The tax was increased to 6% in 2013, and it has generated increasingly larger sums of revenue each year since then.

The diamond tax is a controversial topic, and there are many people who believe that it is unfair to levy a tax on a precious item like a diamond. However, proponents of the tax argue that it is fair because diamonds are not essential items like food or clothing, and they are not necessary for everyday life.

Opponents of the diamond tax also argue that it hurts Missouri's economy because it makes the state less attractive to diamond buyers and sellers. However, supporters of the tax argue that it actually helps the state's economy by generating revenue that can be used to fund education programs.

The debate over the diamond tax will likely continue for many years, but one thing is clear: the tax has generated millions of dollars in revenue for Missouri's schools.

#  Missouri's Diamond Tax revenue reaches $1.8 million

The Show-Me State’s diamond tax has generated more than $1.8 million in revenue since it was enacted in 2016, the Missouri Department of Revenue said Wednesday.

The department said the state has collected $1,823,797 from the 2.5 percent tax on the purchase of diamonds, gemstones and jewelry as of Dec. 31.

The money is used to pay for early childhood education programs.

Rep. Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield, who sponsored the bill that created the diamond tax, said he’s pleased with the amount of money it has generated.

“This is a great example of how a commonsense policy can benefit both our economy and our kids,” he said in a news release.

Gov. Mike Parson also praised the diamond tax, saying it is helping to improve educational opportunities for Missouri children.

“This new revenue is making a significant impact on early childhood education by providing high-quality learning opportunities for Missouri kids,” Parson said in the release.
