#  Get On The Winning Side Of Liga Nos With These Simple Tips

Portugal’s Liga NOS is one of the most hotly-contested football leagues in Europe. With clubs like Benfica, Porto and Sporting Lisbon regularly vying for the top spots, it can be tough to know who to back. Check out our tips below to get on the winning side of Liga NOS!

1. Pick a club and stick with them

Forming an allegiance with one club and sticking with them throughout the season is a great way to make sure you always have someone to root for. Benfica, Porto and Sporting Lisbon are all excellent clubs with passionate fanbases, so picking one of these is a safe bet.

2. Do your research

Before placing any bets, it’s important to do your research on each team and their odds of winning. This will help you make informed decisions and give you the best chance of making some money.

3. Use a reputable betting site

When placing bets, it’s important to use a reputable site that has a good reputation for paying out winnings promptly. There are plenty of sites out there to choose from, so take your time and find one that suits your needs.

#  How To Win Against The House In Liga Nos

In Portugal’s top-flight football division, Liga Nos, champions are usually determined with teams battling it out in the last few matches of the season. However, this campaign, Porto have been the exception to the rule.

They have been dominant all season long, and currently sit 10 points clear at the top of the table with just five games remaining. While they may not be able to be caught by their rivals, there are still ways in which they can be beaten.

There is no one defining way to take down a team as dominant as Porto; it will take a collective effort from their opponents. But if they can do these four things, they will give themselves the best chance possible:

1) Attack The Centre Of Their Defence

Most of Porto’s defenders are comfortable playing on the ball and like to start attacks from the back. This means that if teams can get players in behind them and force them into making mistakes, they can cause problems.

2) Keep The Ball Away From Their Star Players

Porto have several dangerous players who can score goals from anywhere on the pitch. If teams can keep the ball away from them then they will not be able to hurt them as much. Some of these players include Hector Herrera, Yacine Brahimi and Vincent Aboubakar.

3) Force Them Into Errors In Their Own Half

If teams can put pressure on Porto high up the pitch, they will make mistakes which can lead to goalscoring opportunities. This is something that Sporting CP have done well against them in previous meetings this season.

4) Disrupt Their Rhythm & Stop Them Playing Quickly Out Of Defence

One of Porto’s main strengths this season has been their ability to play quickly out of defence and create chances early on in matches. If teams can stop them doing this, it will disrupt their rhythm and make it harder for them to dominate games.
