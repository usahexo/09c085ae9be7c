#  New Slot Machine Feels Like Pinball!

I was in Las Vegas for a work conference and of course had to check out the casinos. I hadn't played slot machines in years, but when I saw the new ones that look like pinball boards, I had to try them!

The board on the machine has different colored lights and buttons, and it's so much fun to play. You can choose to bet one or two coins, and then you just hit the button to start the game.

There are different levels, and as you play you light up different parts of the board. If you get three of the same symbols in a row, you win! The best part is that it feels like you're playing pinball, and it's so much fun.

I only played for a few minutes, but I already can't wait to go back and play some more. If you're looking for a new type of slots game to try, be sure to check out the new ones that look like pinball boards - they're so much fun!
